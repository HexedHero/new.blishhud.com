title: Start GW2 and Blish HUD Together
---

Blish HUD supports launching in tandem with Guild Wars 2 in multiple ways:

**Enable stay in tray:** Enabling stay in tray will keep Blish HUD running between sessions and it will auto attach to Guild Wars 2 when you launch it. This is the easiest way.

**Launch Guild Wars 2 with Blish HUD:** If you have stay in tray enabled or launch Blish HUD before the game shows, you can double-click the Blish HUD icon in the tray (or right-click it for more options) to launch to game.

This means the easiest combo is likely to keep stay in tray enabled and then just double-click the Blish HUD icon in the tray anytime you would like to play GW2.

_Other options:_

**Launch GW2 with Blish HUD:** If you create a shortcut to Blish HUD, you can add a [launch parameter which will auto-launch GW2](https://blishhud.com/docs/user/launch-options#-g---startgw2-1-or-2).

That means your Blish HUD shortcut will essentially do both jobs for you.

Here is the exact bit added at the end:

`--startgw2 2`

The 2 tells it to auto-login. If you prefer it not autologin, you can use:

`--startgw2 1`
